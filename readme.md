# Updating Your GitHub Pages Index

This guide outlines the steps to update your `index.html` file in your GitHub Pages repository after deleting the `main` branch.

## Overview

If you have removed the `main` branch from your repository and want to ensure that your `index.html` is up-to-date, follow these steps. This process includes fetching the latest changes, generating the index, and pushing updates to the `master` branch.

## Step 1: Ensure Your Local Repository is Up to Date

To make sure your local repository reflects the latest changes from the remote repository, run the following command:

```bash
git fetch origin
node generateIndex.js
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update index.html after deleting main branch"
git push origin master
